# Dinkum-NoTanks

A simple mod for Dinkum that allows sprinklers to work without tanks.

Uses a Postfix patch on **SprinklerTile.waterTiles()** that waters nearby tiles a second time, but without being inside a conditional that checks for a water tank in range.


Built for BepInEx 6.0.0-pre.1: [BepInEx_UnityMono_x64_6.0.0-pre.1.zip](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.1)
